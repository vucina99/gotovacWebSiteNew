    When a <strong>traffic accident</strong> occurs, the involved parties have the option to complete a <strong>European Accident Statement</strong>.
    To <em>expedite and simplify</em> the process of claiming <strong>indemnity</strong>, <em>Serbian law</em> permits participants to independently
    fill out this statement <strong>without the need to call the police</strong> for a full on-scene investigation. <br><br>

    If <strong>no injuries</strong> have occurred and all parties <strong>agree on who is responsible</strong> for the accident,
    there is no obligation to involve authorities or call the police. Instead, the parties are only required to complete the European Accident Statement. <br><br>

    When completing the statement, it is crucial that the participants immediately <strong>take photographs of the vehicles</strong> in their collision positions.
    They should then promptly <strong>move the vehicles off the roadway</strong> to prevent obstructing traffic. <br><br>

    Next, they should <strong>photograph the damage</strong> to both vehicles, capturing wide and close-up shots of the scene from multiple angles,
    documenting any <strong>traffic signs</strong>, and, if applicable, photographing any <strong>glass or plastic debris</strong> on the road. <br><br>

    Additionally, all <strong>personal information</strong> of the other party must be collected.
    If there are witnesses, their contact details should also be obtained, as <em>eyewitness testimony can prove invaluable</em> in court proceedings. <br><br>

    While at the scene, <strong>gather as much information and evidence as possible</strong> – the more thorough the documentation, the less likely
    you will encounter difficulties later. For instance, <strong>photographic evidence</strong> can protect you from <em>false witness claims</em>. <br><br>

    After completing the report, it is advisable to <strong>consult a lawyer</strong> of your choosing, preferably one recommended to you. <br><br>

    According to the <strong>Law on Road Traffic Safety</strong>, if there are any <strong>injured persons</strong> involved in an accident,
    it is mandatory for the participants to immediately <strong>call the police and Emergency Medical Services</strong>. <br>
    This ensures that authorities arrive promptly to conduct a <strong>full on-scene investigation</strong> and provide necessary medical assistance,
    including transporting the injured persons to a hospital. <br><br>

    It is common for <em>physical pain</em> to manifest hours or even days after an accident rather than immediately.
    In such cases, the injured party remains <strong>entitled to indemnity</strong> for their injuries, even if Emergency Medical Services did not attend the scene
    and no official police report was filed. <br><br>

    In other words, <strong>injured individuals have the right to claim indemnity</strong> for their injuries even when only a European Accident Statement
    was completed and the police were not involved. <br><br>

    Furthermore, many citizens mistakenly believe that the European Accident Statement only applies to <em>minor damages</em> up to <strong>€500 or RSD 200,000</strong>,
    but <strong>this is not the case</strong>. <br>
    Damage claims amounting to <strong>millions</strong> can be made based solely on the European Accident Statement – a position confirmed by the
    <strong>Appellate Court in Belgrade</strong>. <br><br>

    At <strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong>, we can help you secure <strong>indemnity for non-material damages</strong> caused by your injuries,
    as well as <strong>material damages exceeding RSD 200,000</strong>, even if only a European Accident Statement was completed
    and the police were not called to conduct an on-scene investigation. <br><br>

    <strong>Our services are charged only after the case is successfully resolved.</strong>",

    Citizens of the <strong>Republic of Serbia</strong> generally lack the practice of <strong>insuring their property</strong> as commonly seen in
    <em>European Union countries</em>, and the same applies to <strong>comprehensive motor vehicle insurance</strong>. <br><br>

    Unlike European Union countries, Serbia still faces a <strong>significant lack of awareness</strong> and an
    <strong>underdeveloped approach</strong> to property insurance, including comprehensive motor vehicle insurance.
    Citizens of Serbia often fail to appreciate the importance of proactively protecting their property through insurance,
    and insurance is still viewed more as a <em>cost</em> than as a <strong>responsible risk management strategy</strong>. <br><br>

    Comprehensive motor insurance covers only <strong>about 10% of vehicles</strong> in Serbia, while insurance premiums
    increase annually, often at a double-digit rate. <br>
    (<em>This means that in Serbia, only one out of every ten vehicles is covered by comprehensive motor insurance.
    Although there is no precise data, if Serbia has approximately 2,000,000 vehicles and only every tenth one is insured,
    it follows that around 200,000 vehicles are covered by comprehensive motor insurance.</em>) <br><br>

    There are several reasons for this low number of vehicles covered by comprehensive motor insurance in Serbia, including:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cost of insurance:</strong> Comprehensive motor insurance is more expensive than the mandatory motor third-party liability insurance.
        Many drivers, especially those with older vehicles, find it <em>economically unjustifiable</em> to pay for comprehensive coverage
        when the market value of their car is low. With the <strong>average vehicle age</strong> in Serbia exceeding 15 years, combined with
        <em>low incomes</em> and <em>high living costs</em>, many citizens opt to purchase only the legally required insurance.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lack of trust in insurance companies:</strong> A significant portion of the population believes that insurance companies will
        either <strong>deny their damage claim</strong> or compensate <strong>less than the actual loss</strong>; unfortunately, they are often right.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Due to adverse weather conditions, reported <strong>comprehensive motor insurance damage claims</strong> have risen by <strong>60%</strong> over the past two years.
    Each year, around <strong>40,000 claims</strong> are filed, highlighting a significant recent increase. <br><br>

    When it comes to comprehensive motor insurance damage claims, <strong>insurance companies</strong> often attempt to <em>deny liability</em> whenever possible or,
    if payment is unavoidable, <strong>minimize the amount paid</strong> for vehicle repairs. For this reason, it is essential to have an
    <strong>attorney specializing in indemnity</strong> to ensure you receive what you are rightfully entitled to. <br><br>

    In practice, insurers frequently try to <strong>reduce their payment obligations</strong> or even outright <strong>reject claims</strong>.
    Even in cases where all conditions for payment are clearly met, insurers often offer amounts significantly <em>lower than the actual damages</em>.
    This practice further undermines public trust and discourages citizens from purchasing such coverage. <br><br>

    Additionally, in cases of <strong>TOTAL LOSS</strong>, where repairing the vehicle is <em>economically unjustifiable</em> because the repair costs
    exceed the vehicle’s actual value, insurers in Serbia often misuse their position by <strong>listing the insured vehicle on online auctions</strong>
    or bidding platforms <em>without the owner’s consent</em>. <br>
    Through this practice, the insurer seeks to increase the residual value of the damaged vehicle via bidding, thereby <strong>lowering the indemnity amount</strong> payable. <br><br>

    However, established <strong>court rulings</strong> make it clear that insurers are <strong>not allowed</strong> to auction or publicly sell the insured’s property
    without the vehicle owner’s approval. This legal precedent has been reinforced in cases handled by our law firm before the <strong>Third Basic Court in Belgrade</strong>. <br><br>

    Unlike mandatory liability insurance, <strong>comprehensive motor insurance</strong> is a <em>voluntary insurance</em> that requires entering into a specific contract
    known as a <strong>comprehensive motor insurance policy</strong>. <br><br>

    When purchasing this policy, the insured citizen also agrees to the <strong>General Terms and Conditions</strong>, which form an integral part of the contract.
    Legally, this contract is an <em>adhesion contract</em>, drafted solely by the insurer, with the citizen merely accepting a pre-prepared agreement.
    In other words, the insured is presented with a <strong>“take it or leave it”</strong> contract. <br><br>

    Since most citizens lack legal expertise, they tend to accept and sign terms that are often unfavorable, imposing <strong>numerous obligations</strong>
    they must fulfill to be eligible for compensation. <br><br>

    The insurer includes clauses that can lead to <strong>forfeiture of rights</strong> if the insured fails to meet certain duties after the insured event.
    To protect the citizen as the weaker party, the law declares such <em>unfair provisions null and void</em>. <br>
    Article 918 of <strong>The Law of Contract and Torts</strong> provides that contractual clauses stipulating the forfeiture of the right to compensation
    if the insured fails to execute certain obligations shall be void. <br><br>

    For example, certain provisions stipulate that the insured is obligated to <strong>call the police</strong> after a harmful event,
    and that failure to do so entitles the insurer to refuse indemnity. Such provisions are <strong>null and void</strong> under the aforementioned legal article,
    and the insured will <strong>not lose their rights</strong> if they fail to call the police. <br><br>

    This stance is supported by both the <strong>Appellate Court in Belgrade</strong> and the <strong>Higher Court in Belgrade</strong>.
    Gotovac Law Firm has represented numerous clients in such cases, where the courts ruled in their favor. <br><br>

    Therefore, when a damaging event or traffic accident occurs, the insurer is <strong>obligated to pay damages</strong>, regardless of whether the police were called. <br><br>

    When interpreting adhesion contracts, courts must resolve any doubts in favor of the weaker party –
    <strong><em>IN DUBIO CONTRA STIPULATOREM</em></strong>. </p>",
    "nezgode sa pesacima strana" => "<p><strong>Pedestrian accidents</strong> are one of the most common types of traffic incidents in Serbia and represent a significant public safety issue.<br>
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, approximately <strong>33,000 traffic accidents</strong> occur in the country each year.<br>
As reported by Automoto Revija, there were <em>125 pedestrian fatalities in 2022</em>, <em>134 in 2023</em>, and <em>112 in 2024</em>. This is a considerable number, accounting for around <strong>25% of all traffic-related deaths</strong>.<br><br>

Nearly half of these accidents occurred under the influence of alcohol. <strong>Pedestrians</strong> are among the most vulnerable road users. They move through traffic without any protection, surrounded by fast-moving cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and trucks.<br><br>

If you are involved in a pedestrian accident, we strongly recommend contacting a lawyer who can help you get the compensation you are rightfully entitled to. Insurance companies aim to spend as little on you as possible. They may offer you the bare minimum – or in some cases, nothing at all.<br>
It’s important to understand that insurance companies are not obligated to pay you anything voluntarily.<br>
<strong>A traffic accident</strong> doesn’t just involve covering car repair costs. It also includes medical expenses, physical therapy, loss of earnings while dealing with the case, and more.<br><br>

<strong>What to do if you're involved in a pedestrian accident:</strong><br>
Pedestrian accidents are sometimes fatal. If you're involved in a pedestrian accident in the Republic of Serbia, here’s what you should do:<br>
<strong>Call 194.</strong> By calling 194, you ensure that medical assistance is on its way if needed. Even if no one is injured, the dispatchers will at least send the police to investigate the accident.<br>
<strong>Exchange of information.</strong> While waiting for the police or medical assistance, make sure to exchange information with all parties involved.<br>
<strong>Take photographs.</strong> Photos are crucial for building a successful case. Without photographs, it will be difficult to prove what happened. If you are unable to take photos yourself, try to ask a witness or someone nearby to take them for you.<br>
<strong>Give your statement and never apologize.</strong> Tell the truth to the police in as much detail as possible. This will help them understand what happened and why. <em>Remember: in an accident, an apology is considered an admission of guilt</em>, which could undermine everything your attorney and insurance can do to help you.<br><br>

<strong>Obtain a medical report.</strong> A medical report outlining your injuries, prognosis, and treatment plan will give your attorney a clear idea of the compensation required for your recovery process. This includes physical therapy, surgery, medical examinations, loss of quality of life, and more.<br>
<strong>Obtain a police report.</strong> The police report is a crucial document that can clarify what happened at the scene. It also includes the names of everyone involved in the accident and a list of witnesses to contact. The report will contain your statement, the other party’s statement, and the police’s conclusion about what occurred.<br><br>

By following these steps after an accident, you will gather a clear record of what happened at the scene. This information can significantly help your case. Don’t worry if you’re physically unable to complete these steps yourself. At the <strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong>, we’ll be happy to collect the necessary reports for building your case. Just keep in mind that if you’ve sustained serious injuries, the case may take longer to build, and obtaining reports can take several months.<br><br>

<strong>Common injuries in pedestrian accidents:</strong><br>
Pedestrian accidents are no minor matter. A pedestrian may face far more serious injuries than someone involved in a standard car accident. In some cases, pedestrian accidents are catastrophic or result in death. These injuries include:<br>
<em>Spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, internal organ damage, torn or sprained ligaments, fractures, deep lacerations, nerve damage, broken bones, and death caused by negligence.</em><br><br>

Many of these injuries are caused by distracted driving or driving under the influence of alcohol. In other instances, the pedestrian may have suddenly run into traffic.<br><br>

If you or someone you know has been involved in a pedestrian accident and needs legal assistance, contact the <strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong> in Belgrade immediately. <em>Consultations are free of charge.</em><br><br>

<strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong>, a family-run practice, has <strong>decades of experience</strong> in legal practice and the field of indemnity. We are deeply familiar with the legal nuances that can help you obtain the compensation you deserve.<br><br>

    "stete u javnom prevozu strana" => "<p>In the event of injury to a passenger in public transport, the injured party has the right to <strong>indemnity</strong> based on the carrier’s liability for passenger safety and its insurance company, considering that transport is provided under a contract obligation to ensure safe transportation of the passenger (<em>Public Trust</em>).<br><br>

<strong>Passengers in public transport</strong>, according to the Law on Compulsory Traffic Insurance, include:<br>
1) Persons who are inside the vehicle used for public transport and intend to travel, regardless of whether they have purchased a ticket or not;<br>
2) Persons who are within the vicinity of the station, terminal, airport, or in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle before boarding, intending to travel;<br>
3) Persons who have completed their journey and left the vehicle but remain in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, within the station, terminal, port, or airport area.<br><br>

In all cases, a passenger has the right to indemnity if an injury occurs, regardless of whether they purchased a ticket or not. Additionally, passengers have the right to indemnity if the injury occurred while <em>entering or exiting</em> the bus.<br><br>

The specificity of this type of indemnity is that the carrier and the insurance company are liable under the principle of <strong>STRICT LIABILITY</strong>, which means that it is not necessary to prove whether the driver was at fault for the accident; it is sufficient that the damage occurred in connection with the transport (use of the bus).<br><br>

In the territory of the City of Belgrade, passengers are transported by <strong>GSP</strong>, the city transit company, which is a state-owned enterprise, and their buses are insured with the company <em>“Dunav Osiguranje A.D.O.”</em> Besides the state company GSP, passengers in Belgrade are also transported by private carriers insured with other insurance companies (<em>Sava Osiguranje, Milenijum Osiguranje, AMS Osiguranje, Generali Osiguranje Srbija, Triglav Osiguranje</em>, etc.).<br><br>

A unique feature of this type of indemnity is that a passenger in transport can <strong>claim damages TWICE</strong> based on two completely different policies:<br><br>

1. <strong>The first policy</strong> is the <em>MOTOR THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY INSURANCE CONTRACT</em>, which all motor vehicles must have. This policy covers indemnity for physical pain suffered, fear, mental anguish due to reduced general life activity, disfigurement, medical expenses, loss of earnings, etc. (Article 200 of the Law of Contract and Torts).<br><br>

2. <strong>The second policy</strong> is the <em>MANDATORY ACCIDENT INSURANCE FOR PASSENGERS IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT</em>. Owners of vehicles used for public passenger transport are required to conclude an insurance contract for passengers against the consequences of accidents.<br>
The amount of the minimum sum assured of the contracted accident insurance cover for passengers in public transport shall be established per passenger by the Government, upon the proposal of the NBS.<br>
The insured sum cannot be lower than:<br>
– In the event of the death of a passenger: <strong>8,000 euros</strong>;<br>
– In the event of permanent loss of general working ability (disability) of the passenger: <strong>16,000 euros</strong>;<br>
– In the event of temporary inability to work and actual and necessary medical bills for the passenger: <strong>4,000 euros</strong>.<br><br>

For example, if a bus brakes suddenly and a passenger suffers a broken arm, the insurance company is liable to provide indemnity under the first policy, motor third-party liability insurance, in the following amounts: <em>RSD 220,000 for physical pain suffered, RSD 200,000 for fear endured, RSD 300,000 for reduced life activity, and RSD 80,000 for disfigurement/scarring</em>. Under the second policy, mandatory accident insurance for passengers in public transport, the passenger is entitled to receive <strong>1,600 euros</strong> for 10% disability – bodily injury (100% disability equals 16,000 euros).<br><br>

For minor neck injuries or other minor bodily injuries, passengers may be entitled to amounts ranging from <em>RSD 120,000 to RSD 160,000</em>.<br><br>

It is essential for citizens to understand that the same rules applying to injuries sustained on a bus also apply to injuries suffered in a <strong>TAXI</strong> or a <strong>RENT-A-CAR</strong> vehicle. So, if you're injured in a taxi or a rent-a-car vehicle, you are entitled to indemnity for two types of damages under two insurance policies, just as if you were injured while using public transport, as outlined in the previous paragraph.<br><br>

Injuries most commonly happen due to <em>sudden braking</em>. It is crucial that, when an injury occurs in public transport due to an accident, speeding, a sharp turn, or sudden braking, you immediately call the police to conduct an on-site investigation. You should not attempt to judge the severity of the injury yourself, but instead seek medical and legal advice as recommended.<br><br>

If the insurance company proposes a lower payout, be ready to file a lawsuit to secure the maximum indemnity. Our law firm, <strong>Gotovac</strong>, backed by <strong>30 years of experience</strong>, has successfully handled numerous such cases and can help you claim the maximum indemnity you are entitled to.</p>",
    "smrtni slucajevi strana" => "<p><strong>Traffic accidents</strong> remain one of the leading causes of injury and death in the Republic of Serbia. In the past year alone, <strong>498 lives</strong> were lost in traffic-related incidents, and over the past decade, that number has risen to <strong>6,300</strong>, a devastating and deeply tragic statistic.<br><br>

The immediate family members of the deceased are entitled to <strong>indemnity</strong> for the mental anguish suffered due to the loss of a loved one, as well as compensation for funeral expenses, mourning-related costs, and the loss of financial support.<br><br>

The alarming statistic also shows that up to <strong>80% of close relatives</strong> of the deceased do not receive the fair indemnity to which they are legally entitled, mainly due to inadequate and poor legal representation in court. The family of the deceased remains in mourning for an extended period after the tragic event, and instead of receiving the indemnity for mental anguish to which they are entitled and easing their pain, <em>insurance companies</em> use every possible means to avoid paying or to minimize it.<br><br>

In such difficult times, the family must have a <strong>capable and experienced lawyer</strong> who will, both through out-of-court negotiations and legal proceedings, compel the insurance company to pay all that the family is entitled to, and that in the highest possible amounts. <em>We strongly urge citizens</em> in these situations to hire a lawyer, not just any lawyer, but to carefully research and select those specializing in indemnity, as only skilled and competent counsel can protect their rights and secure fair indemnity for the mental anguish they have endured.<br><br>

Indemnity for mental anguish following the loss of a close relative in <strong>Western European countries</strong> and the <strong>USA</strong> is substantial, often amounting to tens of thousands of euros or dollars per person, whereas in the Republic of Serbia, such compensation is meager:<br>
– For mental anguish following the death of a parent or child, close relatives can receive up to approximately <strong>RSD 1,000,000</strong>.<br>
– For mental anguish following the death of a spouse or a brother or sister, close relatives can receive up to approximately <strong>RSD 800,000</strong>.<br><br>

In order for a brother or sister to receive indemnity for mental anguish, Serbian law imposes an <strong>absurd and unfair condition</strong>: that the brother or sister must have lived in the same household as the deceased. In <em>European Union</em> countries such as Germany and Austria, a wider circle of relatives is entitled to indemnity, and no such conditions are imposed. For example, in Austria, even grandchildren and grandparents of the deceased have the right to indemnity.<br><br>

In our country, close relatives who were supported and assisted by the deceased during their lifetime are entitled to indemnity from the insurance company for the <strong>loss of support</strong>, which they would have regularly received if the tragic event had not occurred. For example, a minor child who lost their father in a traffic accident is entitled to a <strong>MONTHLY indemnity</strong> for the loss of support that they would have received from their father until the age of 25, provided they are enrolled in regular education. A wife has the right to indemnity for the loss of support due to the death of her husband.<br><br>

Insurance companies maintain annual records and statistics tracking which law firms have secured the highest indemnity amounts for citizens of Serbia, and their approach to injured parties often depends on the lawyers representing them. <strong>We are proud to say</strong> that <strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong> has consistently ranked at the top of these lists for years, successfully recovering some of the largest indemnity amounts.</p>",
    "stete na vozilima strana" => "<p>“Traffic is a constant battle,” as our people like to say. In this “battle,” around 400 traffic accidents occur daily within the territory of Belgrade, while nearly 1,000 happen across the Republic of Serbia. In every accident, Serbian citizens suffer material damage to their vehicles (<em>damnum emergens</em>). Anyone seeking the indemnity at the highest possible amount should under no circumstances rely solely on the damage assessment provided by an <strong>APPRAISER</strong> employed by the insurance company responsible for paying the claim. In the Republic of Serbia, most insurance companies are foreign-owned and typically aim to reject damage claims or pay the minimum amount to the injured party. Meanwhile, large sums of money, measured in millions of euros annually, are transferred out of Serbia. Foreign insurers strive to collect as high premiums as possible for their policies but avoid providing indemnity when damage occurs. Disturbingly, statistics show that only 18% of injured parties hire a lawyer and receive fair indemnity, while the remaining 82% are denied the same, a situation insurance companies count on.<br><br>
When the injured party reports damage to an insurance company, one can hardly expect objectivity in the damage assessment and calculation from the very party obliged to pay, as this would present a direct <strong>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</strong>.<br><br>
Insurance company appraisers often classify parts that need replacement on the damaged vehicle as repairable, declare total losses as partial, refuse to recognize many parts, depreciate some parts by up to 50%, and attempt to reduce the damage amount in every possible way. In most European Union countries, insurance companies are prohibited from employing <strong>APPRAISERS</strong> who assess the amounts the insurer must pay. Instead, there are independent <strong>DAMAGE ASSESSMENT CENTERS</strong>. A similar system exists here as well. Our law firm, Gotovac, cooperates with court-appointed mechanical engineering expert witnesses who are registered in the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Serbia. These experts strive to assess damages adequately and maximally, unlike the <strong>APPRAISERS</strong> employed by insurance companies, who tend to minimize the assessments. Our expert witnesses use the computer application “<strong>AUDATEX</strong>,” which is used by expert witnesses throughout the European Union. Therefore, their assessments carry significant evidentiary weight and value in court because they are sworn court expert witnesses. If individuals or companies report damage directly to an insurance company and the damage is assessed by the insurer’s<br><br>
<strong>APPRAISERS</strong>, they can expect minimal indemnity that will often not even cover the cost of repairing their vehicle. On the other hand, if you engage professionals such as attorneys and court expert witnesses, you can expect maximum indemnity, more than enough to repair your vehicle and even have some money left over.<br><br>
When it comes to <strong>TOTAL LOSS</strong> of a vehicle, that is, when repairing the vehicle is uneconomical because the repair costs exceed the vehicle’s value, insurance companies in the Republic of Serbia very often abuse their position by posting photos of your vehicle on various internet <strong>AUCTIONS</strong> or <strong>BIDDINGS</strong>, offering your vehicle for sale to third parties without your consent. Through these auctions, the insurance company tries to increase the value of the damaged remains of the vehicle, thereby reducing the indemnity. Court practice holds that insurers are not allowed to list damaged vehicles of claimants on auctions or bids without the vehicle owner’s consent, as this reduces the damages. The court practice of the Third Basic Court in Belgrade was established based on cases from our law firm.<br><br>
<strong>COMPREHENSIVE MOTOR INSURANCE DAMAGES</strong><br>
The same applies to comprehensive motor insurance damages. Without a good lawyer and mechanical engineering expert witness, you will not be able to effectively deal with the insurance company or receive the indemnity you deserve.<br><br>
<strong>DAMAGES CAUSED BY ROAD POTHOLES</strong><br>
Lately, there has been a growing number of claims for indemnity due to vehicle damage caused by potholes. This is a direct result of the poor state of the roads, not only in Belgrade but across the entire Republic of Serbia.<br>
Potholes can cause significant damage to vehicles, including tire blowouts, rim damage, axle repairs, and other costly fixes that sometimes exceed €10,000. If the damage occurs within the City of Belgrade, the responsible road maintenance company is Putevi Beograda. For incidents on main roads or highways, liability falls on Putevi Srbije, while in smaller towns, the local road maintenance company or municipal authority is accountable. What’s notable in these cases is that almost no road maintenance company agrees to provide indemnity without court intervention; nearly all cases require resolution through legal proceedings.<br><br>
<strong>DAMAGES ON THE HIGHWAY</strong><br>
If damage occurs on the highway due to a collision with a wild animal, a dog, or any other sudden obstacle on the road, Putevi Srbije is liable to provide indemnity for your damages. By paying toll fees, you pay Putevi Srbije to ensure safe travel to your destination, and if damage occurs, the road maintenance company is liable to provide indemnity based on the principle of “He who enjoys benefits, also bears the burden.” Putevi Srbije almost never voluntarily does out of court; nearly every case ends up in court, and indemnity is only obtained after they lose the lawsuit, which happens regularly.<br><br>
<strong>DAMAGES CAUSED BY WILDLIFE</strong><br>
If an accident occurs on a main road as a result of a collision with a wild animal, the party liable for indemnity is the local <strong>HUNTING ASSOCIATION</strong> responsible for managing wild game in the area where the incident took place. Since hunters and hunting associations derive benefits from wildlife, they also bear liability for any damage caused by wild animals to vehicles, in line with the legal principle: “<strong>HE WHO BENEFITS MUST ALSO BEAR THE BURDEN</strong>.” Most hunting associations are insured through AMS Osiguranje, which, as the insurer, is liable to provide indemnity to the injured party.<br><br>
<strong>DAMAGES CAUSED BY FALLING TREES</strong><br>
If your vehicle is damaged due to a falling tree, damages must be claimed from the owner of the land where the tree is located, who is responsible for maintaining the tree’s crown. Such damages are often not minor and can exceed RSD 1,000,000.<br>
If a tree falls on public property within the territory of the City of Belgrade, which is not uncommon, the party liable for indemnity is the public utility company JKP Gradsko zelenilo Belgrade, as it is responsible for maintaining public green areas. If a tree falls from a neighboring yard located on privately owned land, the individual owner of that property bears the responsibility for indemnity. However, if the tree falls due to extreme weather conditions such as strong storms, hurricanes, heavy rainfall, or snowfall, classified as an act of God (<em>vis maior</em>), then the liability of Gradsko zelenilo is excluded. In each case, what qualifies as an act of God is determined by the Hydrometeorological Institute in Belgrade.<br><br>
We appeal to citizens of Serbia, companies, and foreign individuals not to engage various agencies, limited liability companies, or other individuals (often of questionable qualifications and expertise who engage in pseudo-legal practice) in indemnity proceedings.<br><br>
Instead, seek legal assistance from qualified lawyers who are professionally trained, legally accountable for their work, and, according to the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, are the only authorized persons to provide legal assistance to citizens.<br><br>
Gotovac Law Firm, a family-run practice established in 1996, does not require upfront legal fees; instead, we operate on a contingency basis, agreeing on a percentage in advance and collecting our fee only upon the successful resolution of your case.

    "stete na kamionima strana" => "<p>On the roads of Serbia, trucks with both domestic and foreign vehicle registration plates are involved in a large number of traffic accidents. You encounter them on highways, parked near stores, and on almost every city street, most frequently on highways. Although eighteen-wheelers usually do not pose a danger, accidents involving them can be extremely serious and even fatal. Currently, there are about <strong>308,000</strong> freight vehicles registered in Serbia, but a large number of foreign trucks also operate on Serbian roads. According to an analysis by the Road Traffic Safety Agency, trucks were involved in <strong>86%</strong> of fatal traffic accidents. By contrast, buses were involved in only <strong>16%</strong> of cases. About <strong>12%</strong> of the deceased were truck drivers, while <strong>46%</strong> were drivers or passengers in passenger vehicles, and <strong>35%</strong> were pedestrians. Due to their large size, trucks pose an increased danger both to themselves and to other road users. Because of the great weight of trucks, which can reach several tens of tons, they have much longer stopping distances compared to regular passenger vehicles. In collisions between trucks and smaller vehicles, physics works against the smaller, weaker party, which suffers drastic damage. Additionally, trucks have large blind spots, causing pedestrians, cyclists, and smaller cars to “disappear” from the driver’s view. Truck drivers often drive long shifts and may be tired and sleep-deprived, which is another common cause of truck accidents. Furthermore, many roads in Serbia are not adequately adapted for truck traffic.<br><br>
A study by the Road Traffic Safety Agency also shows that the number of trucks and freight vehicles in Serbia is increasing, and the rate of accidents involving commercial trucks is rising every year. If you are involved in an accident involving a truck in Serbia or Republika Srpska, you will need a law firm specializing in indemnity for truck damages.<br>
Our law firm collaborates with court-appointed mechanical engineering expert witnesses who specialize in assessing truck damage. Our expert witnesses always strive to secure the maximum amount because truck parts are very expensive.<br>
Therefore, it is crucial to find an experienced truck accident attorney in Serbia who can guide you through these challenges. At <strong>Gotovac Law Firm</strong>, we protect our clients from being taken advantage of by insurance companies. We have successfully secured substantial indemnity amounts for our clients and will strive to ensure you receive the maximum indemnity for your injuries and truck damage. Our firm offers free consultations and operates on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay legal fees only if we win your case. Moreover, we are fully committed to obtaining everything you are entitled to. While you may feel overwhelmed by the accident, we will help you navigate the complexities and bureaucracy, managing the entire process of receiving indemnity with a fee agreed upon in advance.<br><br>
<strong>LOSS OF PROFIT (<em>LUCRUM CESSANS</em>)</strong><br>
When a traffic accident occurs, the truck owner is entitled not only to indemnity for the damage to the truck but also to indemnity for loss of profit resulting from the inability to use the truck for business purposes. Loss of profit refers to the income the truck owner would have earned had the accident not taken place. For instance, if a truck is unable to operate due to an accident, and consequently misses out on contracted transportation jobs. The amount of loss of profit is assessed by our mechanical engineering expert witness, who calculates the potential daily earnings of the truck if it had remained operational and then multiplies that figure by the number of days needed for repairs. Information regarding the daily earning capacity of a specific truck is obtained from the Association of Transport. Trucks engaged in international freight transport suffer significantly greater loss of profit compared to those operating solely within the Republic of Serbia.<br><br>
When a traffic accident damages a truck, the indemnity amounts involved are often substantial, so it is essential that the assessment of both the truck damage and the loss of profit is carried out by qualified professionals rather than unqualified estimators. Our law firm proudly represents numerous transport companies across the Republic of Serbia and Republika Srpska.</p>",

Even though the damage to your vehicle may be expensive to repair and the repair costs are high, the harm to your health is the most concerning aspect of any traffic accident. When a vehicle is damaged, the damage can be compensated because “EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PAID FOR IS NOT EXPENSIVE,” but there are also damages that are irreparable and cannot be restored to their previous condition before the accident, such as non-material damages resulting from severe bodily injuries and fatalities. The injured person may suffer minor or severe bodily injuries. Minor bodily injuries are those that heal quickly and often leave no permanent consequences, such as whiplash injuries to the neck, abrasions, cuts, lacerations, bruises, contusions, sprains, etc. Indemnity for minor bodily injuries usually ranges from RSD 120,000 to RSD 150,000.<br><br>When it comes to serious bodily injuries, these are severe injuries that very often leave lifelong consequences, such as bone fractures, skull fractures, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, internal bleeding of the brain or internal organs, facial injuries, jaw and tooth damage, etc. What citizens of Serbia need to know is that insurance companies have never paid a fair and adequate amount to injured parties for serious injuries in out-of-court settlements, covering physical pain, fear, mental anguish, reduced life activity, disfigurement, and similar damages. Indemnity for serious bodily injuries ranges from several hundred thousand Serbian dinars to multi-million amounts, depending on the nature of the injuries and the injured person&#39;s recovery. Insurance companies will do everything to minimize the damage. For the injured party to fully exercise their rights, it is necessary to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit with the competent court. Only after the legal process and medical expert witnesses, evaluations by orthopedists, traumatologists, and psychiatrists can the injured person expect the court to award the maximum indemnity. Court-awarded amounts are always higher than the amounts offered by insurance companies in out-of-court settlements. If the injured party cannot afford medical expert witness assessments and court costs, we, as lawyers, will take on the responsibility of covering these expenses in order to ensure that citizens receive the maximum and fair indemnity for their serious bodily injuries.<br><br>Damages in beauty and aesthetic correction salons: In beauty salons and aesthetic correction clinics, injuries often occur because many so-called salons or clinics operate without proper licenses and work “off the books,” while the individuals performing the procedures are often unqualified practitioners. For this reason, serious injuries to your health can result. Our law firm represents victims in over 20 cases related to injuries or burns caused by unsafe hair removal, massages, and facial aesthetic treatments. Sometimes, these injuries are permanent and occur on visible parts of the body (such as the face). The injured party has the right to indemnity from the person responsible for causing the damage.<br><br>Attorneys at the Gotovac Law Firm do not charge upfront fees for representation; instead, we work on a contingency fee basis, agreeing on a percentage in advance and collecting our fee only upon the successful resolution of your case.</p>
