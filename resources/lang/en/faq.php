    'naplata stete text' => "If you, or someone close to you, have experienced a traffic accident, a workplace injury, or a dog bite by a stray dog within the past three years and are uncertain about your rights, our law office can help you secure the compensation you are entitled to.
<br><br>

In the previous year alone, there were 37,127 traffic accidents recorded across the country. When it comes to workplace injuries, up to 25,000 cases are reported annually, ranging from minor to severe injuries.
<br><br>

A significant number of traffic accident victims and injured workers fail to claim their right to compensation simply due to a lack of awareness of their legal entitlements.
<br><br>

Moreover, many citizens do not have the financial means to pursue full compensation through costly and time-consuming court proceedings, which typically require multiple expert assessments. As a result, they often accept settlements from insurance companies that are far below the amounts they could obtain through consistent and diligent application of the law in court.
<br><br>

Our law office assists clients in exercising their rights to full compensation for both material and non-material damages, and is here to:
<br><br>

Review all available documentation,<br>

Obtain legal and evidentiary documentation from prosecutors’ offices and other relevant authorities,<br>

Submit a compensation claim to the insurance company on your behalf,<br>

Negotiate with insurers to secure the compensation you are legally entitled to,<br>

Ensure that every injured party receives full compensation through court proceedings, in accordance with the law.<br>
<br><br>

In traffic accident cases, compensation is collected from the insurance company, not from the liable party personally. In workplace injury cases, compensation is collected directly from the employer, while in cases of stray dog bites, compensation is paid by the City of Belgrade.
<br><br>

Our law office also represents foreign insurance companies in recourse proceedings against domestic insurance companies before Serbian courts.
<br><br>

In over 70% of cases, insurance companies either avoid paying compensation to injured parties or pay only partial amounts, relying on statistics that show only a small percentage of injured individuals will hire a lawyer and initiate court proceedings.
<br><br>

If, during the course of our representation, it becomes clear that you will not receive financial compensation, our Services are completely free of charge. We do not solicit clients by phone or send promotional letters by post — our best recommendation is the large number of satisfied clients who have placed their trust in us.

    'naplata potrazivanja text' => 'One of the major challenges faced today by both individuals and businesses is the irregular collection of receivables.
<br><br>

The debtor’s failure to pay is one of the most common causes of insolvency and illiquidity, leading to poorer business results for creditors and, at the same time, an inability to settle their own obligations on time.
<br><br>

The longer creditors wait to decide on the necessary course of action, the lower the chances of successful recovery. In this regard, the activities of our law office are focused on:
<br><br>

Conducting a detailed review of the debtor’s business situation over the past few years via <a href="www.boniteti.rs">www.boniteti.rs
</a> (whether the debtor is already in litigation, what movable and immovable assets they own, whether they have had blocked accounts, their liquidity status, financial turnover, etc.),<br>

Sending formal notices demanding timely settlement of outstanding debts,<br>

Engaging in professional communication with the debtor regarding repayment of the debt.<br><br>

Our law office maintains successful cooperation with accounting agencies in providing legal Services to their clients. Based in Belgrade, our office offers debt collection Services for clients throughout the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska.',
    "proces" => "How long does the compensation process take?",
    "proces text" => "When all conditions are met and the necessary documentation has been submitted, the insurance company is legally obliged to pay the full amount within 14 days. However, the speed of resolution depends on the complexity of each individual case – some claims may be processed even sooner. If it becomes necessary to initiate court proceedings, the process is significantly prolonged, as litigation generally takes more time.",
    "nepoznato" => "I was hit by an unidentified vehicle. What should I do next?",
    "nepoznato text" => "You should immediately contact the police so that an official accident report can be prepared. After that, contact our office so we can help you gather the necessary documentation and be fully prepared for the moment when the responsible party is identified. This will allow us to initiate the compensation claim process.

Please note: if the liable party is not identified, compensation cannot be obtained. In such cases, the mandatory liability insurance policy (the basic policy used for vehicle registration) does not cover the damages.",
    "postupak" => "How does the process of claiming compensation work?",
    "postupak text" => "First, we approach the insurance company with a claim for compensation, since their insured is responsible for the damage caused.
This step represents an out-of-court procedure, where we try to resolve the situation amicably and achieve fair compensation.
If this is not successful, the next step is initiating court proceedings, in order to ensure through legal process that your rights are protected and that the damage is adequately compensated.",
     "neosigurano" => "Is there a right to compensation if I was hit by an uninsured vehicle?",
    "neosigurano text" => "Yes, you are entitled to compensation. If the police report confirms that the vehicle responsible for the accident was not insured, the damages can be claimed through the Guarantee Fund of the Association of Serbian Insurers. This fund exists precisely for such situations, ensuring that injured parties receive fair compensation even when the liable driver does not have valid insurance coverage.",
    'prvo' => "What should I do in the event of a traffic accident?",
    'prvo text' => "The first step is to call the traffic police so that an official accident report can be prepared. In cases of minor damage, you may complete the European Accident Statement. After that, contact the Law Office Gotovac as soon as possible so we can assist you with the next steps and ensure that you receive fair compensation."
